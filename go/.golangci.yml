    #- lll # [to many false positives] reports long lines
    #- testpackage # [do not want] makes you use a separate _test package

    #- wrapcheck # checks that errors returned from external packages are wrapped
    #- wsl # [too strict and mostly code is not more readable] whitespace linter forces you to use empty lines

    #- errchkjson # [don't see profit + I'm against of omitting errors like in the first example https://github.com/breml/errchkjson] checks types passed to the json encoding functions. Reports unsupported types and optionally reports occasions, where the check for the returned error can be omitted
